title: Would I Back This Project?
---

This past Friday, we had a second round of project presentations. While I got through my presentation without too many problems, I do wish that I did more with the project overall. I'd really like to go back and visit many aspects of this project after I finish the bootcamp. It definitely needs some editing. And I could incorporate feedback as well. I should definitely have a lot more free time in a couple months.

I suppose I should've started with the topic of my project. I attempted to model funding for Kickstarter board game projects. Board games are a big deal to Kickstarter as a company. The "games" category reached [$1 billion dollars](https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/16/kickstarter-game-projects-top-1-billion-with-tabletop-making-up-69-of-pledges/) of funding since 2009 for Kickstarter, and board games accounted for 70% of that total. The games category continues to be the biggest funder for [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats) making up 20% of their total funding.

Kickstarter is also important to the board game industry and community as a whole. Five of the top 10 games of 2019 were Kickstarter projects according to [boardgamegeek.com](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/265685/best-games-2019). And the highest ranking game of all time on [boardgamegeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame) is Gloomhaven, also originally funded on Kickstarter. It's sequel, [Frosthaven](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frosthaven/frosthaven), is currently doing quite well on Kickstarter at the time of this blog post.

I think one of my big problems was not managing my time well. It probably took me longer than it should have finding a project idea that I liked. But that wasn't actually the problem. I ended up spending too much time scraping my data. I actually scraped 90% of the data I ended up using on time. But I spent 3 or 4 days trying to get data that I would've liked to have used only to discover it likely wasn't going to be useful in the end.

Kickstarter has an "advanced" search page where you can select various options for projects including category, location, percent funded, and sorting options. Here's an example of what that looks like:

Kaggle
- Has holdout data that you never see which your score is based on




Web scraping
- Beautiful Soup seemed very inconsistent
- Selenium seems like it has a lot of overhead because it uses a browser
  - Explore "headless" browser when using Selenium
  - Use the sleep timer at the right time
    - Need the page to refresh when looping/loading through links
- Other features to scrape
  - Grab text and analyze
  - Get number of pictures
  - Get number of videos

Didn't give myself enough time at the end
  - Presentation was a bit inconsistent
    - e.g. heatmap vs statsmodel

Take better notes on feedback
- Is this one the github website somewhere?

One interesting thing I can reflect on at the end of the project is how my classes in statistics affected my project. On the one hand, I was familiar with a lot of the concepts such as OLS regression, some metrics (e.g. R-squared, RMSE, etc.), and deciphering output from statmodels (looks very similar to output I recall seeing when using R in my stats classes). On the other hand, it seems like I didn't really take in how a data scientist would evaluate a model compared to a statistician (at least, based on my classes back then - it might be different in practice today). When I was deciding on what features to include with my simple linear regression model, I used p-values. But I should've taken another look at Lasso regression. I had forgotten how you could make the LARS graph to see how lasso regression eliminated features. I'd like to see how that compares to using p-values.


So would I back my project? Well, not without some additional work. Some projects on Kickstarter don't make their funding goal the first time around. But if a creator is open to feedback and puts more time into making the project better, then they are often successful the next time they launch their project on Kickstarter.


Back in 2015, [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/crowdfunding-is-driving-a-196-million-board-game-renaissance/) highlighted the fact that from 2009 - 2015, board games made almost $200 million dollars on Kickstarter.

[kickstarter.com](https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/1-billion-and-counting-pledged-to-games) announced another $600 million was pledged bringing the total from the games category to $1 billion with most of that money due specifically to board games according to [venturebeat.com](https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/16/kickstarter-game-projects-top-1-billion-with-tabletop-making-up-69-of-pledges/). The games category has made the most the most money on Kickstarter with about 20% of total funding according to the [kickstarter.com](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats).
