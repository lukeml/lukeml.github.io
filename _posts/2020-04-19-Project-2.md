title: Would I Back This Project?
---

Last Friday (at least at the time this should've been posted), we had a second round of project presentations. While I got through my presentation without too many problems, I do wish that I did more with the project overall. I'd really like to go back and visit many aspects of this project after I finish the bootcamp. Both my code and my slides need work. Incorporating the feedback I received would be also be a good idea. I can't really spare the time at the moment, but I should definitely have a lot more free time in a couple months. For now, I'll note some items of interest about this project.

One of my first challenges was deciding on a topic. This step took me longer than it should have. Sometimes when presented with a wide variety of options, I suffer from something called ["analysis paralysis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis). I first ran into this term while playing board games. Basically, I will occasionally take an excessive amount of time making a move. I hate it when I make a move, and then realize 30 seconds later that there was a better option. I've been trying to work on this issue because I don't want to bring a game to a halt due to indecision. In real life, a quick suboptimal decision is usually better than a perfect decision that comes too late.

I finally decided to go with a board game-related topic. I used to play board and card games with friends and family when I was younger but have only recently gotten back into the hobby. I've been growing my board game collection, and one popular source of new board games is Kickstarter, a crowdfunding site. I've spent way too much time and money on Kickstarter. I actually maintain a Google spreadsheet for tracking the Kickstarter projects that I've backed. I may have a problem. But that's a topic for another blog post.

The basic idea of my project was to attempt to model funding for Kickstarter board game projects. Board games are a big deal to Kickstarter as a company. The "games" category reached [$1 billion dollars](https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/16/kickstarter-game-projects-top-1-billion-with-tabletop-making-up-69-of-pledges/) of funding since 2009 for Kickstarter, and board games accounted for 70% of that total.  The games category continues to be the biggest funder for [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats) making up 20% of their total funding.

Kickstarter is also important to the board game industry and community as a whole. Five of the top 10 games of 2019 were Kickstarter projects according to [boardgamegeek.com](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/265685/best-games-2019). And the highest ranking game of all time on [boardgamegeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame) is Gloomhaven which was originally funded on Kickstarter. It's sequel, [Frosthaven](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frosthaven/frosthaven), is currently doing quite well on Kickstarter at the time of this blog post:

So, as an avid fan of board games, I tend to keep an eye on board games that launch on Kickstarter.

After deciding on a topic, the next step was to get the data. This step required familiarization with Beautiful Soup and Selenium. Kickstarter has an "advanced" search page where you can select various options for projects including category, location, percent funded, and sorting options. Here's an example of what that looks like at the top of this image:
![kickstarter_search]({{ site.url }}/images/kickstarter_search.PNG)
Selenium was required because the search results are dynamically generated showing about a half-dozen projects at a time.

One nice thing about Selenium is that it's easy to find what you're looking for by inspecting the page and copying the XPath of the item of interest.
![xpath]({{ site.url }}/images/xpath.png)
For example, I found that the images on a Kickstarter project all had the same XPath, so I could copy the Xpath for one and then use the "find_elements_by_xpath" command to find all the images. I found this to be much easier than navigating using the typical Beautiful Soup commands.

Another interesting tool to use when using Selenium is the idea of a "headless" browser. Normally when using Selenium with Google Chrome, you have to let the page refresh or update on your computer. With a ["headless" version](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome) of Google Chrome, the browser is not actually displayed. So scraping data can be many times faster with such browser.

I managed to get about 90% of the data I ended up using by the end of the week. But I spent the weekend trying to get data that I would've liked to have used only to discover that the data likely wasn't going to be useful in the end. For example, I thought it might be interesting to analyze the text on a project's page using packages that are readily available (a good suggestion from Alice) such as ones listed [here](https://pypi.org/project/textstat/). Perhaps the calculated ease of reading would be a useful feature. Unfortunately, many projects don't actually use text on the project page. [Frosthaven](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frosthaven/frosthaven), which I mentioned earlier, only uses images with text embedded in those images. Lots of other projects do this as well. When I was chatting with Da, he mentioned that this might have been done because it makes formatting of text a non-issue on any device that might access the webpage. So for project creators that don't have dedicated web developers, this makes life much easier for them. Unfortunately, this fact also disrupted my plans to use the number of images on a project page as another feature.

Another limitation that I quickly discovered was that the Kickstarter search results maxed out at 200 pages which translated to about 1000 projects in the last three months. So this lack of data prohibited me from doing analysis based on time over months or years. It probably would've been interesting to see if there were trends over those time periods. But, in the end, I was running out of time, so I suppose these limitations were for the best.

I eventually acquired my data and did my analysis. It didn't turn out great. But I was able to get some experience with web scraping and using regression with Python. One thing I can reflect on at the end of the project is how my classes in statistics affected my project. On the one hand, I was familiar with a lot of the concepts such as OLS regression, some metrics (e.g. R-squared, RMSE, etc.), and deciphering output from statmodels (looks very similar to output I recall seeing when using R in my stats classes). On the other hand, it seems like I didn't really take in how a data scientist would evaluate a model compared to a statistician (at least, based on my classes back then - it might be different in practice today). When I was deciding on what features to include with my simple linear regression model, I used p-values. But I should've taken another look at Lasso regression. I had forgotten how you could make the LARS graph to see how lasso regression eliminated features. I'd like to see how that compares to using p-values.

So would I back my project? Well, not without some additional work. Some projects on Kickstarter don't make their funding goal the first time around. But if a creator is open to feedback and puts more time into making the project better, then they are often successful the next time they launch their project on Kickstarter. I hope to revisit my own project when I have more time, maybe after I've (hopefully) successfully completed the bootcamp. If nothing else, it's been a good learning experience!
